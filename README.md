## Custom Portfolio Site

This is a custom-built portfolio site using Rust (with Actix Web and Diesel) for the backend, and React (with Vite, React Router, and Tailwind CSS) for the frontend. Its purpose is to showcase a collection of projects, each with its own chapters and entries to explain or document the project. This site is both a technical showcase and a place where I document my work and ideas.

The code is public, so theoretically, anyone could build this site for themselves and have their own portfolio site.
