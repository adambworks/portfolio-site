## Quick Overview
This is a custom built portfolio site built using Rust (with Actix Web and Diesel) for
the backend, and React (with Vite React Router and Tailwind css) for the frontend. It's purpose is to showcases a
collection of projects, each with there own chapters and entries to explain or document the project. This site is both a technical showcase and a place where I document my work and ideas.
The code is public, so theoretically anyone could build this site for themselves and have there own portfolio site.## More Info
